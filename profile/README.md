## What is Telehack?

[Telehack](https://telehack.com/) is a simulation of a stylized ARPANET/Usenet, circa 1985-1990.  It is a full multi-user simulation, including 26,600+ simulated hosts from the early net, thousands of files from the era, a collection of adventure and IF games, an [advanced BASIC interpreter](https://github.com/telehack-foundation/.github/blob/main/basic.md) with a library of programs to run, simulated historical users, and more.

Founded in 2010 by its anonymous creator [forbin](https://github.com/telehack/) (the name is a reference to Dr. Charles Forbin, the protagonist of the 1970 movie [Colossus: The Forbin Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project)), Telehack has grown far beyond its original design, and is now home to a lively community of over 50,000 programmers, technology enthusiasts, and curious explorers.

The system and its many components are still actively maintained by [The Telehack Foundation](https://github.com/orgs/telehack-foundation/people/), and many Telehack users release new creations on a regular basis.
